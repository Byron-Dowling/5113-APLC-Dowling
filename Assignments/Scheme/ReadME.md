## Assignment:	Program 1 - LISP Scheme - Perfect Numbers

      A perfect number N is a positive integer such that the sum of the proper divisors less than N is
      equal to N. If the sum is greater than N, the number is abundant. If the sum is less than N, the
      number is deficient.

      Examples:

      - 6 is a perfect number because 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
      - 12 is abundant because 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 > 12
      - 14 is deficient because 1 + 2 + 7 < 14

      Write a program that classify a number as perfect, abundant, or deficient following the guidelines
      below:

          - As with all programs, include your name and explanation of program in comments at
            the top of your program as well as in code output.

          - Use one or more functions to determine the classification of the number. Use tail
            recursion to sum the factors of the given number.
