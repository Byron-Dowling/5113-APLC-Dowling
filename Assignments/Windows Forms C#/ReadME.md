This gui will take a plaintext message along with that cipher's input values/keys and encrypt the message upon clicking the cipher button.\

There are pop-up labels available that give some insight into each cipher and how they work.\
Additionally, there is a button to initialize the alphabet A-Z so you can easily see how the cipher's affect the shift alphabet.
